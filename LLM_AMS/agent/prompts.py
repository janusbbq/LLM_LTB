# ---------------------------------------------------------------- Classifier
CLASSIFIER_SYSTEM = """
You classify the user's message into ONE of six AMS routes.

The message may be written in English OR Chinese — classify by MEANING, not by
matching English keywords. (e.g. "换成ieee39" = switch case to ieee39 → case_io;
"运行/求解/计算" = run/solve → solve; "改成UC/切换到UC" = set routine → configure.)

- **question_general**: Conceptual / educational questions about AMS, scheduling, optimization, DCOPF, RTED, ED, UC, CVXPY, cvxpy-based formulations, market simulation, ANDES integration.
  Examples: "What is RTED?", "Difference between DCOPF and RTED?", "Why disable plflb?", "What does config_t do?"

- **question_parameter**: Discovery — what routines / cases / solvers / loads / generators / lines are available in the loaded system.
  Examples: "What routines can I run?", "Which solvers are installed?", "List loads", "Show generators", "What cases ship with AMS?"

- **case_io**: Load, inspect, or export a case file.
  Examples: "Load case 5bus/pjm5bus_demo.xlsx", "Switch to ieee14_uced", "换成ieee39节点", "Load matpower/case118.m", "Show me the current case info"

- **configure**: Change ROUTINE settings — active routine, solver, config_t (interval), enable/disable constraints.
  Examples: "Use solver SCS", "Switch routine to DCOPF", "切换到UC", "Set interval to 1 hour", "Disable plflb and plfub", "Re-enable rgu"

- **modify**: Change the PHYSICAL system — load values, generator on/off, line on/off, line rate_a.
  Examples: "Change load PQ_1 to 3.2", "Trip generator PV_1", "Trip line Line_2", "Restore PV_1", "Set Line_3 rate to 0.6"

- **solve**: Run the active routine (RTED, DCOPF, ED, UC, ...).
  Examples: "Solve", "Run RTED", "运行", "求解", "Run the dispatch", "Solve with CLARABEL"

Pick the BEST single category for ``message_type``. If the message clearly mixes
multiple actions that must run in sequence (e.g. "change load PQ_1 to 3.2 then
solve", or "换成ieee39节点，运行uc问题" = switch to ieee39 AND run UC), pick the
LAST action for ``message_type`` AND set ``is_multi_step`` = true so the planner
can split it. A single action is NOT multi-step.

# ----------------------------------------------------------- Q&A reference
AMS_CONCEPTS_CONTEXT = """
**Key AMS / scheduling concepts:**

- **AMS (LTB AMS)**: Python library for scheduling modeling + co-simulation with ANDES. Builds CVXPY problems from descriptive routine classes; solves via cvxpy backends. Repo: CURENT/ams.

- **Routine**: A scheduling problem (DCOPF, RTED, ED, UC, ACOPF, DCPF, PFlow, DOPF, ...). Each routine has variables (e.g. pg, plf), constraints (e.g. plflb, plfub, pglb, pgub, rbu, rbd, rgu, rgd), an objective, and a config (e.g. interval t).

- **DCOPF**: DC optimal power flow — single-period LP minimizing generation cost subject to DC line-flow + balance.
- **RTED**: Real-Time Economic Dispatch — DCOPF + reserve regulation (SFR). Default interval t = 5/60 hour.
- **ED**:  Economic Dispatch — multi-period DCOPF over a horizon.
- **UC**:  Unit Commitment — mixed-integer multi-period scheduling (on/off + dispatch). Needs MIP solver.
- **ACOPF**: AC optimal power flow (non-convex relaxation). Phase 2+.
- **DCPF / PFlow**: power-flow-only routines (no optimization).

- **Constraints commonly disabled in studies**: plflb / plfub (line flow lower/upper), rgu / rgd (regulation up/down), pglb / pgub (gen lower/upper).

- **PQ.alter vs PQ.set**: ``alter`` converts to system base and persists to dumped case; ``set`` writes only to the runtime per-unit value (does not affect input file). After EITHER, call ``routine.update(...)`` so the optimization model sees the change.

- **StaticGen / PV / Slack**: aggregated generator references. Trip a unit with ``StaticGen.set(src='u', idx=..., attr='v', value=0)``.

- **Line trip**: ``Line.alter(src='u', idx=..., value=0)`` then ``routine.update()``. Line flows for tripped lines become 0.

- **routine.disable([...]) / enable([...])**: turn specific constraints off / on. After ``run``, AMS rebuilds the model if needed.

- **routine.config.update(t=1)**: change interval (hours). Triggers reinit on next ``update()`` because t is a non-parametric change.

- **Solvers**: open-source CLARABEL, OSQP, SCS for LP/QP/SOCP; HiGHS / SCIPY / SCIP for MILP/LP; commercial GUROBI, MOSEK, CPLEX, COPT if installed. ``cvxpy.installed_solvers()`` lists what's available now.

# ----------------------------------------------------- Configure / Modify extraction
CONFIGURE_EXTRACT_SYSTEM = """
Extract configuration changes from the user's request.

Targets:
- ``case_path``       — load a different case file or AMS alias
- ``routine``         — set active routine (RTED, DCOPF, ED, UC, DCPF, PFlow, ACOPF, DOPF, ...)
- ``solver``          — set cvxpy solver (CLARABEL, OSQP, SCS, HIGHS, SCIPY, SCIP, GUROBI, MOSEK, CPLEX)
- ``config_t``        — RTED/ED interval in hours (e.g. 1, 0.0833)
- ``disable_constraint`` — turn off a constraint by name (e.g. plflb, plfub, rgu, rgd)
- ``enable_constraint``  — turn on a constraint by name

Rules:
1. Extract ALL changes implied by the user in one structured response.
2. Use canonical routine names UPPERCASE (RTED, DCOPF, ED, UC).
3. Use canonical solver names UPPERCASE (CLARABEL, OSQP, SCS, ...).
4. For ``disable_constraint`` / ``enable_constraint``, emit one entry per constraint.

MODIFY_EXTRACT_SYSTEM = """
Extract PHYSICAL system modifications from the user's request.

Targets:
- ``load_p0``      — change a load's p0 (active power). Needs ``idx`` (e.g. ``PQ_1``) and ``value`` (pu).
- ``gen_trip``     — turn a generator OFF. Needs ``idx`` (e.g. ``PV_1``). No value.
- ``gen_restore``  — turn a generator BACK ON. Needs ``idx``.
- ``line_trip``    — take a line OUT of service. Needs ``idx`` (e.g. ``Line_2``).
- ``line_restore`` — put a line BACK in service. Needs ``idx``.
- ``line_rate``    — change a line's ``rate_a``. Needs ``idx`` and ``value`` (pu).

Rules:
1. Extract ALL modifications in one structured response.
2. Use the canonical AMS idx strings exactly as they appear in the snapshot below.
3. **Values are in per-unit (pu)** by default, on the system base (typically 100 MVA).
   Only convert to pu if the user EXPLICITLY says "MW" or "kW" (divide by 100 for MW).
   Examples: "change load PQ_1 to 3.2" → value=3.2 (pu). "set load PQ_1 to 320 MW" → value=3.2 (pu).

**Loaded element idxes**:
- loads (PQ): {load_idx}

# ----------------------------------------------------- Planner (compound queries)
PLANNER_SYSTEM = """
Decompose a multi-step AMS request into an ordered list of single-route steps.

The request may be in English OR Chinese — decompose by MEANING. Each step's
``content`` should be a clear instruction (English is fine) the route can run.

Each step picks ONE route action:
- question_general
- question_parameter
- case_io
- configure
- modify
- solve

Rules:
1. Preserve user order.
2. Each step's ``content`` MUST be a complete natural-language instruction
   the corresponding route can execute independently.
3. Switching the CASE (loading a different case file/alias) is ``case_io``.
   Switching the active ROUTINE (RTED, DCOPF, ED, UC, ...) is ``configure``.
   So "run UC on ieee39" = load ieee39 (case_io) → set routine to UC
   (configure) → solve.
4. Always end with ``solve`` if the user asks for results / plot / objective
   after their changes.

Example — user: "换成ieee39节点，运行uc问题" (switch to ieee39, run the UC problem):
  step 1 case_io   "load case ieee39"
  step 2 configure "set the active routine to UC"
  step 3 solve     "run the active routine"
